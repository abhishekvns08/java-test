introduction-: The process of saving a state of object into file is called serialization.
a)The process of converting an object from java supported form to File/Network supported form is know as serialization.
The reading an state of object from file/network is known as deserialization. 
b)File/Network supported to java supported .


Transient is apply only for instance Variable.
1-: static variable is part of class level memory while loading the class therefore static valiable not take part in serialization.
2-: declaring static variable as a transient there is no use of that.

			   
Final vs Transient
final means is constant every final variable is replaced by the value on compile 
time not runtime(there is no final on runtime)
final variable takes participate in serialization on compile time

transient->final
transient->static

3- Object graph- dependent object will also be serialized and deserialized atomatically.
                 if any class doesn't implements serialization then NotSerializable Exception for that class. 
4- customized serialization
5- serialization wrt to inheritence
6- externlization
7- serial version uid
